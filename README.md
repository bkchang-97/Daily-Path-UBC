For this project, I have designed a function called plot_route that will take in a csv file
with my daily schedule for school and plot a map of UBC showing where I go throughout the day, with
node markers for locations I visit and highlighted paths for the shortest path it takes for me to
walk there. My function plot_route will take in 'fn' which represents the file name of the CSV file as
a string, I have included a few days as CSV files which will produce different paths.
