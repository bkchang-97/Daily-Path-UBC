(IGNORE THIS FILE!!!)
The primary purpose of this project is to plan a roadtrip! The input data is simply a constraining itinerary of
dates and locations. The output of the project will be to suggest a sequence of routes that will satisfy the itinerary.

For example, suppose you are following a musician over a summer of concerts. You know the musician will be in
Atlin, BC, on July 4, and they will be in Vancouver on July 8, and in Nelson, BC on July 10. Your planner
should start at Atlin, and should suggest places to stay between Atlin and Vancouver so that you arrive in
Vancouver at or before July 8. It should then similarly navigate a trip to Nelson.

Note that we are not prescribing the itinerary that you must follow... the same fucntionality could be used, if you
were following a musician, or a migration of animals, or a weather phenomenon.
